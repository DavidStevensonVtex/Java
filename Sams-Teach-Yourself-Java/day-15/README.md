# Sams Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days

## Day 15: Working with Input and Output

### Introduction to Streams

Two types of streams:

* byte steams
* character streams

Character streams handle only textual data.

#### Using a Stream

* `java.io`
* `java.nio.file`

* `FileInputStream` - `read()` method returns a byte read from the file
* `BufferedWriter` - `write()` method writes a character to the file
* `close()` method closes a file stream
