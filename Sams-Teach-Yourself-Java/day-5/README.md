## Day 5: Creating Classes and Methods

### Defining Classes

A class is defined via the class keyword and the name of the class.

```
class Ticker {
    // body of the class
}
```

By default, classes inherit from the Objet class. It's the superclass of all classes in the Java class hierarchy.

class SportsTicker extends Ticker {
    // body of the class
}
